Features:
- Async pausing using 'p'
- Async quitting with saving using 'q' (this requires implementing fcntl on linux and threading I suppose).
- Windows implementation of async console operations.
- Windows support of console title change, since ANSI escape codes have undefined behaviour in Windows' cmd
- Config files to override defaults

Logging:
- Currently, the program defaults to logging in the user's home folder.
  Add support for locating the home folder (%HOMEPATH%) on Windows
- The program implicitly assumes all sessions are 25 minutes, so log the session time as well

Custom Commands:
- Add "report" command to summrize your learning time today and show your overall progress.
- Implement a scalable system for argument parsing to have the option for adding more arguments in the future
- Better the help screen in case argument syntax is wrong.
